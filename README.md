### Paragraph explaining the purpose of UT, how & what I want to test based on the findings of my heuristic evaluation

The purpose of UT is to identify possible pain points of the tested product/design, and consider the thoughts and difficulties of the user to be able to assess the efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction of the product or design. Effectiveness is measured through accuracy and completeness with which users achieve specified goals. Efficiency is determined by the time and resources expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness with which users achieve goals. Finally, satisfaction is measured through a Likert scale where the participant grades his/her attitudes and comfort levels towards the product, whether it be positive or negative. The core of ux design is design for the user. Inherently, testing the product/design with the users is crucial. UT serves a variety of purposes such as informing design, eliminating frustration, and improving profitability. It helps the creator identify design/product issues, while directing them to allocate the proper amount of resources proportional to the severity of the issue. Furthermore, it reduces the costs of servicing the design/product. It is always better to do a UT test rather than nothing, as the benefits are immense. I will be conducting a UT, testing my participant on the highest severity issues in the heuristic evaluation I conducted last week, of The Department of Economic and Social Affairs (from now on I'll abbreviate to DESA) Sustainable Development website ( https://sdgs.un.org/ ). I will do so by asking the user to complete three tasks and hopefully uncover the issues I determined last week. I will ask the user a variety of different questions and record insight while he/she is participating in the UT.

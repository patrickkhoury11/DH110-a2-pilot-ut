## Patrick Khoury | DH110 | Assignment A2 - Pilot UT | Dr. Sookie Cho

The Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) Sustainable Development is a department run by the United Nations, an intergovernmental organization made up of 193 member states committed to maintaining peace, dignity, and equality on a healthy planet. Based on a global survey, conducted by international research agency Glocalities, indicates that the United Nations is trusted significantly more by the world population than any other international or governmental organization.

In this sector, the United Nations defines 17 Sustainable Department Goals (SDG) for all. The purpose of this website is to help inspire and mobilize actions promoting the implementation of SDGs around the world. Using the latest data and estimates, the annual SDG report provides an overview of the world’s implementation efforts to date.

For DESA Sustainable Development, severe usability issues I found from my heuristic evaluation were as follows:



### Paragraph explaining the purpose of UT, how & what I want to test based on the findings of my heuristic evaluation

The purpose of UT is to identify possible pain points of the tested product/design, and consider the thoughts and difficulties of the user to be able to assess the efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction of the product or design. Effectiveness is measured through accuracy and completeness with which users achieve specified goals. Efficiency is determined by the time and resources expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness with which users achieve goals. Finally, satisfaction is measured through a Likert scale where the participant grades his/her attitudes and comfort levels towards the product, whether it be positive or negative. The core of ux design is design for the user. Inherently, testing the product/design with the users is crucial. UT serves a variety of purposes such as informing design, eliminating frustration, and improving profitability. It helps the creator identify design/product issues, while directing them to allocate the proper amount of resources proportional to the severity of the issue. Furthermore, it reduces the costs of servicing the design/product. It is always better to do a UT test rather than nothing, as the benefits are immense. I will be conducting a UT, testing my participant on the highest severity issues in the heuristic evaluation I conducted last week, of The Department of Economic and Social Affairs (from now on I'll abbreviate to DESA) Sustainable Development website ( https://sdgs.un.org/ ). I will do so by asking the user to complete three tasks and hopefully uncover the issues I determined with the website in the heuristic evaluation last week. I will ask the user a variety of different questions and record insight while he/she is participating in the UT.

### Paragraph describing what I have learned during pilot test, what went well and what did not go well, focusing on how I want to improve my UT in the future

Through this UT, I discovered that being a moderator is much harder than I initially anticipated. Moderators have to remain unbiased in every circumstance and be careful with every word or action. Any slip up in delivery or interaction with the participant could contaminate the validity of the data collected or bias it in some way. Body language, the way questions are worded, the responses you give the participant, etc could all lead to biased results if not absolutely careful. For instance, changing sitting position may alert the participant that you are changing your attention or interest, whereas fidgeting legs or hands indicate nervousness. I learned that to avoid troubles as a moderator it is best to be an observer, watching the participant throughout the UT rather than lead the test or take notes. It’s important to remain flexible and positive so the participant is encouraged to work through any struggles they may encounter. Playing dumb is a helpful strategy when participants may look to you for help. It's important to listen to the participant intently and avoid any premature conclusions. 

I believe the UT went well. The purpose of UT is to identify possible pain points and consider the thoughts and difficulties of the user to be able to assess the efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction of the product or design. I believe my UT accomplished these standard goals completely and was overall successful. The next time I conduct a UT, it will not be on zoom as there is a 40 minute timer to zoom meetings unless you have zoom pro, which I do not. It was a little stressful paying attention to the time limit, when a good usability test involves the participant getting more than enough time to . Although the participant naturally finished within the 40 minute window, it attracted my attention away from the userat times. I think experience will go a long way in improving my UT in the future. During the test, I had to constantly remind myself to adhere to the guidelines of being a successful moderator. This would not have happened if I were more practiced in UT. I found it extremely difficult to remain unbiased in every way, but I am sure I will improve with more experience conducting UT.
